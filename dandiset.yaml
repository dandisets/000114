description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important for
  offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
  nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
  in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it is
  unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling and cortical
  plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored the behaviour
  of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and litter. This documentary
  approach was synchronized with neural recordings from the virgin PVN, including
  oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins were enlisted in maternal
  care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins into the nest and demonstrated
  pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal retrieval, which activated PVN
  oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting. Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour
  by social transmission, providing a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers
  to infant needs via endogenous oxytocin.
